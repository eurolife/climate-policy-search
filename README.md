This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Once you've cloned or downloaded this repo, Make sure you have node.js installed. [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then you'll need to run npm install to get all the dependencies:

 ```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox/Grid

### Notes

If time allowed, I would most likely want to further improve the search feature to be more granular, and I would also write a lot more tests. 

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
